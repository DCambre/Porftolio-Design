                <p>
                    Eyes are the first judges we ever face, a good impresion is the best way to reach potential clients.
                    I started my journey here, letting my imagination flow, only guided by few specific rules, in order to reach the complete potential of a brand.
                    Is not just colors and drawings, it's about the experience.

                <h3>UI/UX Design</h3>
                <p>
                    The art of making ideas real.
                    It all starts with a wireframe, that leads to a concept. The importance of combining beauty with usability, making people's journey something else than good.
                    Still finding my style, without forgeting why we do it.
                    We do it for the people

                <p>
                    The creative process. Same way my father used to calculate what is need to make a solid structure and a stylized outside, I do it on a computer.
                    The key to visibility is a website, understanding SE and coding are the only tool I need for that.
